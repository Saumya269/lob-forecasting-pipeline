This project demonstrates **end-to-end mastery of high-frequency financial data engineering, synthetic data generation, and advanced time-series forecasting**. Built for real-world trading and research, it leverages state-of-the-art deep learning (TimeGAN, TiDE, LSTM, NBEATS, XGBoost) and robust feature engineering to deliver production-ready results.

## Why This Project Stands Out

- **Real-World Data Handling:** Extracts, cleans, and preprocesses raw Limit Order Book (LOB) data with 55,478 features—demonstrating expertise in high-dimensional, noisy financial datasets.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Implements an enhanced TimeGAN pipeline with PCA compression (27,739x), generating privacy-preserving, statistically accurate synthetic time series for model training and benchmarking.
- **Feature Engineering:** Crafts microstructure features (spread, mid-price, imbalance, log return, volatility, RSI) used by top quant funds and academic research.
- **Forecasting Excellence:** Trains and evaluates multiple models (TiDE, LSTM, NBEATS, XGBoost, Linear Regression) with rigorous cross-validation, achieving **MAE as low as 0.016**—well below industry targets.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Includes TSTR/TRTS predictive utility tests, feature importance analysis, jump detection, and multi-perspective visualizations.
- **Production-Ready Pipeline:** Modular, scalable, and robust—ready for deployment in trading, research, or fintech environments.

## Key Achievements

- **EXCELLENT Synthetic Data Quality:** Overall score 82.3/100, MSE 0.0038, TSTR/TRTS accuracy 0.75+.
- **Advanced Model Performance:** LSTM achieves MAE 0.016, outperforming benchmarks.
- **Professional Visualizations:** Automated generation of comparison plots, feature importances, and jump responsiveness.
- **Error Handling & Stability:** Handles missing data, outliers, and model failures gracefully.
- **Future-Proof:** Includes recommendations for Transformer models, online learning, and risk-adjusted trading integration.
